                <h3>1. Payment Form</h3>
                <p>The payment form allows users to securely enter their payment details, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Card Number:</strong> The credit or debit card number.</li>
                    <li><strong>Expiry Date:</strong> The expiration date of the card.</li>

                <h3>2. Transaction Simulation</h3>
                <p>Our system simulates payment processing to ensure a seamless user experience. After submitting the payment form, the system will:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Process the Payment:</strong> Simulate the transaction based on the entered details.</li>
                    <li><strong>Return a Message:</strong> Provide feedback indicating whether the payment was successful or failed.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="feature">
                <h3>3. Fraud Detection</h3>
                <p>To enhance security, our interface includes a basic AI model that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Flags Potential Fraudulent Transactions:</strong> Uses predefined criteria such as transaction amount and location to identify suspicious activity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Alerts Users:</strong> Notifies users if a transaction is flagged as potentially fraudulent.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="feature">
                <h3>4. Transaction Insights</h3>
                <p>Leverage AI to gain valuable insights into transaction patterns:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Analyze Patterns:</strong> Examine data to identify common transaction times and high-risk areas.</li>
                    <li><strong>Generate Reports:</strong> Use insights to make informed decisions about transaction trends and security measures.</li>
